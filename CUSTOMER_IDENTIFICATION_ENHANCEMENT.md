## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Customer Creation Logic
```javascript
// 1. Search by NIC (Primary)
if (patientNIC.trim() && patientNIC.length >= 9) {
  // Search existing customers by NIC
  // Update info if customer exists
  // Create new if not found
}

// 2. Search by Phone (Secondary)
if (!customerFound && customerContact.trim() && customerContact.length >= 9) {
  // Search existing customers by phone
  // Check for NIC conflicts
  // Update accordingly
}

// 3. Create New Customer (with validation)
if (!customerFound && hasRequiredData) {
  // Validate uniqueness
  // Create with proper metadata
  // Set primary identifier
}
```

### Search Enhancement
